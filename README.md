Programming the Raspberry Pi
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Raspberry Pi is very small computer that you can use to build projects that light up, move, sense and respond to people, animals, plants and the rest of the world. We are going to use the Raspberry Pi with LEDs and photo resistors. You may want to watch [this 5 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jA8wYqQLBU&t=34s) for a quick overview of the Raspberry Pi. You may also find the [Raspberry Pi PowerPoint slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz2ZkT6qWPYTQk85WklyVml2M00) helpful. In this assignment, you and a partner will build and program a series of projects. There is nothing to turn in for this assignment. When you get one of the following projects working, call your instructor over to show them, and then start working on the next

Blinking LED
=============
Our first project will be to create a circuit with a single LED. More details to come

Multiple LEDs that blink in a random pattern
=============
You will create a circuit with at least 4 LEDs. You will then write a program that uses an array to store the GPIO numbers and blink the LEDs in a random pattern. More details to come

Multiple LEDs that blink in a random pattern
=============
You will create a circuit with at least 2 LEDs and 2 buttons. You will then write a program that allows a user to turn the LEDs on and off with the buttons. More details to come

Control an animation with a photo resistor
=============
You will create a circuit with photo resistor. You will then write a program that input from the photo resistor to control an animation on the computer screen. More details to come
